Project Summary:
NC-News is a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion website.

The user is able to select articles they wish to read more about, vote and add comments.

There is no sign-in authentication as this was not a focus for the project.

This is an ongoing work in progress project with the functionality being implemented before full styling is complete.

It leverages the APIâ€™s from my News API backend project.
